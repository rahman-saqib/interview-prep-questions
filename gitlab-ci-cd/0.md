### **GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Questions**

11. **What is CI/CD in GitLab?**
    - Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared repository frequently, while Continuous Deployment (CD) automates the process of delivering the code to production.

12. **How does GitLab CI work?**
    - GitLab CI uses `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, which defines a pipeline configuration. The file specifies the scripts to run for each job in the pipeline.

13. **What is the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file?**
    - It is a YAML file that defines the structure and sequence of CI/CD jobs in GitLab. This file is placed in the root of the project repository.

14. **What are GitLab pipeline stages?**
    - Stages in a GitLab pipeline are phases such as `build`, `test`, and `deploy`. Jobs are executed in the order of stages.

15. **What is the difference between stages and jobs in GitLab CI/CD?**
    - Stages represent a phase in the CI/CD process, while jobs represent the tasks to be executed in each stage.

16. **What are artifacts in GitLab CI/CD?**
    - Artifacts are files generated by jobs, which can be stored and used by other jobs in later stages of the pipeline.

17. **What is a pipeline trigger in GitLab?**
    - A pipeline trigger allows you to start a pipeline for your project from outside GitLab, such as from a different project or application.

18. **How do you manage environment variables in GitLab CI/CD?**
    - Environment variables can be set within the GitLab interface under project settings or defined directly in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

19. **What are GitLab environments?**
    - Environments in GitLab are used to represent different stages of your deployment, such as `production`, `staging`, or `development`.

20. **What are GitLab runners and how are they used in CI/CD?**
    - Runners are agents that run the jobs defined in GitLab pipelines. They can be configured to run on different environments such as Docker, Kubernetes, or shell executors.

### **Advanced GitLab CI/CD Questions**

21. **What are the types of GitLab Runners?**
    - Shared runners (provided by GitLab) and specific runners (dedicated to your project).

22. **How do you set up caching in GitLab CI/CD?**
    - Caching can be set up in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file using the `cache` keyword, which specifies which files and directories to cache between jobs.

23. **What is the use of `needs` in GitLab CI?**
    - The `needs` keyword allows a job to start before its stage if the specified jobs it depends on have completed.

24. **How can you deploy to Kubernetes using GitLab CI/CD?**
    - You can integrate GitLab with Kubernetes clusters to deploy applications using Auto DevOps or custom pipelines.

25. **What is Auto DevOps in GitLab?**
    - Auto DevOps automatically configures CI/CD pipelines, based on best practices, for applications detected in your GitLab project.

26. **What are GitLab Pages?**
    - GitLab Pages is a feature that allows you to deploy static websites directly from a GitLab repository.

27. **How do you implement parallel jobs in GitLab CI/CD?**
    - Jobs can run in parallel by using the `parallel` keyword in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

28. **What is a manual job in GitLab CI?**
    - A manual job requires a user to manually trigger its execution, often used in situations like production deployments.

29. **How do you secure sensitive information in GitLab CI/CD pipelines?**
    - Sensitive data, such as passwords and tokens, can be stored in GitLab CI/CD as masked environment variables or secrets.

30. **What is the purpose of GitLab CI/CD templates?**
    - Templates provide reusable and shared configurations for `.gitlab-ci.yml` to avoid repetition and follow best practices.

### **Practical GitLab CI/CD Scenarios**

31. **How do you debug a failing pipeline in GitLab?**
    - You can review pipeline logs, check for syntax errors in `.gitlab-ci.yml`, ensure dependencies are correctly configured, and use GitLab's debugging tools like retrying jobs.

32. **How do you implement a rollback strategy in GitLab CI/CD?**
    - Rollbacks can be achieved by creating a separate job in the pipeline that reverts to a stable previous version or by using a feature like GitLab environments with protected deployments.

33. **How do you integrate GitLab CI with third-party services like Slack?**
    - GitLab provides built-in integrations for third-party services, and you can also use webhooks to notify services like Slack about pipeline events.

34. **How do you test Docker images in GitLab CI?**
    - You can define jobs to build, test, and deploy Docker images by using the `docker` executor in GitLab CI and the `docker` command within the job.

35. **How would you set up a multi-project pipeline in GitLab?**
    - Multi-project pipelines can be configured by using triggers and cross-project access tokens, allowing pipelines from one project to trigger pipelines in another project.
