Here’s a set of real-world, scenario-based technical interview questions related to GitLab, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, and CI/CD processes, along with sample answers. These questions can help in understanding practical applications and solving real-world problems.

### **1. What is the purpose of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file?**
**Answer:**  
The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defines the pipeline's stages, jobs, and conditions for the CI/CD pipeline in GitLab. It allows for automation, testing, and deployment based on specific triggers.

### **2. How do you define stages in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file?**
**Answer:**  
In the `.gitlab-ci.yml`, stages are defined at the top level:
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy
```

### **3. Can you explain the difference between `script` and `before_script` in `.gitlab-ci.yml`?**
**Answer:**  
- `before_script`: Commands executed before each job, unless overridden.
- `script`: Commands that are executed for the job itself.
```yaml
before_script:
  - echo "Setting up environment"
script:
  - echo "Running main job script"
```

### **4. How would you handle different environment variables in GitLab pipelines?**
**Answer:**  
Use the `variables` section to define environment-specific variables or pass variables via the GitLab UI (CI/CD settings) or group-level variables.
```yaml
variables:
  STAGING_DB: "staging_database"
  PRODUCTION_DB: "production_database"
```

### **5. How do you define and run multiple jobs in parallel in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` pipeline?**
**Answer:**  
Jobs in the same stage run in parallel. For example:
```yaml
stages:
  - test

job1:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Job 1"

job2:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Job 2"
```

### **6. How can you run a job only for specific branches in GitLab CI?**
**Answer:**  
Use the `only` keyword to specify the branches for the job:
```yaml
job_name:
  script:
    - echo "Running for specific branch"
  only:
    - master
    - develop
```

### **7. How do you handle failed jobs in a GitLab pipeline?**
**Answer:**  
You can use the `allow_failure` directive to ignore failures in certain jobs:
```yaml
job_name:
  script:
    - false
  allow_failure: true
```

### **8. How can you create manual jobs that require user intervention in GitLab?**
**Answer:**  
By using `when: manual`:
```yaml
deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to production"
  when: manual
```

### **9. What are `artifacts` in GitLab CI, and how do you use them?**
**Answer:**  
Artifacts are files generated by a job that are passed to other stages or jobs. You define them like this:
```yaml
job_name:
  script:
    - make
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - binaries/
```

### **10. How do you cache dependencies between jobs in GitLab CI?**
**Answer:**  
You can cache dependencies to speed up the pipeline:
```yaml
cache:
  paths:
    - .m2/repository
```

### **11. How would you deploy to multiple environments using GitLab CI/CD?**
**Answer:**  
You can create separate jobs for each environment:
```yaml
stages:
  - deploy

deploy_staging:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to staging"
  environment:
    name: staging

deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to production"
  environment:
    name: production
```

### **12. How do you implement conditional job execution in GitLab CI?**
**Answer:**  
Use rules with `if` conditions:
```yaml
job_name:
  script:
    - echo "Conditional execution"
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "master"'
```

### **13. How can you automatically trigger a pipeline in another project from a GitLab CI pipeline?**
**Answer:**  
Use the `trigger` keyword to call a downstream pipeline:
```yaml
trigger_another_pipeline:
  stage: deploy
  trigger:
    project: mygroup/another-project
    branch: master
```

### **14. How do you ensure that a job runs only when there are changes to a specific file or directory?**
**Answer:**  
Use the `only` keyword with changes:
```yaml
job_name:
  script:
    - echo "Job runs only on file change"
  only:
    changes:
      - src/
```

### **15. How do you configure a scheduled pipeline in GitLab?**
**Answer:**  
Scheduled pipelines are configured in the GitLab UI, under CI/CD > Schedules, where you can set the pipeline to run at specific times.

### **16. What is `CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME`, and how is it used in a GitLab pipeline?**
**Answer:**  
`CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME` is a predefined variable in GitLab CI that represents the branch or tag name for the current pipeline. It is often used in deployment strategies.

### **17. How do you handle Docker images in GitLab CI pipelines?**
**Answer:**  
Use the `image` keyword to specify the Docker image for the job:
```yaml
image: node:14

job_name:
  script:
    - npm install
```

### **18. What is the purpose of the `extends` keyword in `.gitlab-ci.yml`?**
**Answer:**  
The `extends` keyword allows jobs to inherit configuration from other jobs or templates to avoid duplication:
```yaml
.default_job:
  script:
    - echo "Base script"

job_name:
  extends: .default_job
```

### **19. How can you handle secret values like passwords in GitLab CI?**
**Answer:**  
Use GitLab’s CI/CD Variables to securely store sensitive information. These can be referenced in the pipeline as environment variables.

### **20. How would you skip a pipeline run for specific commits?**
**Answer:**  
Use `[ci skip]` in the commit message to prevent GitLab from running the pipeline for that commit.

### Advanced Questions

### **21. How would you debug a failed pipeline in GitLab?**
**Answer:**  
Use the job logs to trace the failure, and you can also use `retry` to rerun the job. Use `artifacts: when: always` to keep logs for debugging purposes.

### **22. How can you share artifacts between different jobs in a pipeline?**
**Answer:**  
Artifacts generated in one job can be passed to subsequent jobs:
```yaml
build_job:
  script:
    - make build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - build/

test_job:
  script:
    - make test
  dependencies:
    - build_job
```

### **23. How can you limit the pipeline to only run on merge requests in GitLab?**
**Answer:**  
Use the `only: [merge_requests]` directive:
```yaml
job_name:
  script:
    - echo "Run on merge requests only"
  only:
    - merge_requests
```

### **24. How can you use GitLab CI for Blue-Green deployment?**
**Answer:**  
This requires having two environments (blue and green). Based on the current environment in production, you can switch deployment between them.

### **25. How do you handle rollback in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline?**
**Answer:**  
You can maintain a rollback job that uses the previous artifact or Docker image to revert to an older release.
